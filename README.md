# Record It

**Record It** is a React-Native mobile application, giving musicians better organization over their song ideas. The app provides most of the value of a traditional recording app, with the added benefit of being able to use folders extensively throughout the app. This allows musicians to have a more clear idea of what they have to work with so that they can accumulate ideas and implement them more effectively.

***note:** The work on this project is still in progress. While the skeleton of the UI is basically what the project will look like, it has been decided to leave styling until the end, when all UX decisions have been finalized.*
